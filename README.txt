/**
 * Moodle module: Subcourse
 *
 * The module provides very simple yet useful functionality. When added into a 
 * course, it behaves as a graded activity. The grade for each student is took 
 * from a final grade in another course. Combined with metacourses, this allows 
 * course designers to organize courses into separate units.
